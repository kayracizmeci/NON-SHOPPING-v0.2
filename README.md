# NON-SHOPPING v0.2

NON-SHOPPING is a simple text-based Python game where you try to get the highest score by buying as many fruits as you can while keeping as much of your starting balance as possible.

This is an improved version of the game. The first release was a quick prototype made in a short amount of time, so I decided to update and clean it up in v0.2.
